# Speedrun Timer Bars

This plugin adds a bar underneath some bosses' health bars that
indicates the pace you need to beat to get the most difficult
speedrunning task for that boss. Custom speedrun times can also
be used.

### Currently supported bosses

- Vorkath
- Vardorvis
- The Whisperer
- The Leviathan
- Zulrah
- Duke Sucellus
- Phantom Muspah (a little weird with prayer phase)
- Amoxliatl
- Fragment of Seren
- Galvek
- TzHaar-Ket-Rak's First Challenge
- The Nightmare
- Phosani's Nightmare
- Hespori (still needs to be tested)

### Potential expansion

I may also implement bars for final bosses of encounters
that involve multiple enemies or preparation stages, including
the following.

- Hueycoatl
- Crystalline Hunllef
- Corrupted Hunllef
- Glough (under the hood this fight consists of 
multiple Glough NPCs, which will require more complicated timing code
to handle)
